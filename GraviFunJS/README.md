# GravifunJS
Fun with some gravitational physics on the web.

A simple javascript file to include in your project so you can have a cool window into space on you page.

Currently the physical simulation is fairly rudimentary with Newton's law of gravity implemented, and some deformable impact dynamics.

This package also implements a very light weight "rendering loop".

There are liberties taken with the physics to make it look cool!

<b>How to use:</b>

Insert a DIV like so:

&lt;div id="gravContainer" style="width:100%; padding:0; margin:0;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


Somewhere into you html page:


Then include the gravityjs.js file like so:


&lt;script src="{{pathto}}/gravityjs.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

You should be good to go!
